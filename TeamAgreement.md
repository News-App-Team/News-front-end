## Cooperation Plane:

**Malik** : responsible and helpful person, he usually works under pressure.

**Abdallah**: creative person.

**Hasan**: organized person.

**Lina**: cooperative, patience person.

**Duaa**: helpful, positively one and do a lot of things at the same time.
And all of us have ambition and goal to success, and we will do.

To best utilize the strengths of our team in the execution of our project, we could consider assigning tasks and responsibilities based on individual strengths. For example, Malik could be assigned tasks that require working under pressure, Abdallah could be tasked with brainstorming creative solutions, Hasan could be responsible for organizing project timelines and resources, Lina could facilitate communication and cooperation among team members, and Duaa could assist with multitasking and completing multiple tasks simultaneously.

we could identify areas where each team member would like to improve and provide opportunities for learning and growth. This could include attending relevant training sessions, watching YouTube videos that improve our team skills, or assigning tasks that require new skills or knowledge.

To ensure that every team member understands all aspects of the project, we could schedule regular team meetings to discuss project updates and progress.
we could also encourage open communication and collaboration among team members to ensure that everyone is aware of the project's goals, objectives, and requirements. Additionally, we could assign cross-functional tasks or responsibilities to encourage each team member to learn about different aspects of the project and broaden their skill set.

## Conflict Plan:

In order to effectively handle conflicts that may arise during the project, the team should establish a clear process for resolving disagreements. This should involve identifying the issue at hand, discussing and analyzing the situation, and agreeing on a resolution that is acceptable to all team members.

If one team member is dominating the project and not allowing others to contribute, this issue should be addressed immediately. The team leader could have a private conversation with the individual to discuss their behavior and encourage collaboration with others. Clear expectations and boundaries for each team member's role and responsibilities could also be set.

It's important to recognize that not all team members will have the same level of understanding and skills. To address this, tasks and responsibilities could be assigned based on individual strengths and opportunities for learning and growth provided. Open communication and collaboration should also be encouraged to share knowledge and skills.

If a team member is not contributing adequately, the team could approach the individual privately to offer support or assistance. If the issue persists, the team could address the situation collectively and establish clear expectations for each member's contribution.

If attempts to resolve conflicts are unsuccessful, the team could escalate the issue to a mediator or external party, such as a supervisor or TA representative. It's crucial to prioritize resolving conflicts to ensure the success of the project and maintain a positive team dynamic.

**Breaks**: our team should agree on a schedule for taking breaks at every hour from the beginning of meeting.

**Falling Behind**: when anyone of our team is Falling Behind, we should establish a plan for how to address falling behind schedule, as reallocating tasks or cooperative with each other.

**After-hours and Weekends**: our team agree on how to communicate during after-hours and weekend work, by send message on WhatsApp group during morning time.

**Ensuring Equal Participation**: by Distribution the tasks between us.

**Establishing a Safe Environment**: The team leader should establish guidelines for respectful communication and feedback that promotes inclusivity within the team, such as informing our team members of the resulting punishment of that, like doing more tasks.

## Work Plan:

To ensure that all team members are equally involved and working on important tasks, the following work plan could be implemented:

**Task Identification and Assignment**: The team should identify all tasks required for the project and assign them based on each member's strengths, skills, and interests, and our team leader watch all of us and what we solve at Trello and GitHub platforms.

**Task Completion Tracking**: The team should track task completion to ensure tasks are completed on time and to the required standard.
